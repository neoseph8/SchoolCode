#1. Call the cost of your dream home total_cost
#2. Call the portion of the cost needed for a down payment portion_down_payment
#For simplicity, assume that portion_down_payment = 0.25  (25%)
#3. Call the amount that you have saved thus far current_savings
#You start with a current savings of $0
#4. Assume that you invest your current savings wisely,  with an annual return of r 
#(in other words, at the end of each month, you receive an additional current_savings*r/12  funds to put into your savings
#â€“ the 12 is because r is an annual rate). Assume that your investments earn a return of r = 0.04 (4%)
#5. Assume your annual salary is annual_salary
#6. Assume you are going to dedicate a certain amount of your salary each month to saving for the down payment
#Call that portion_saved
#This variable should be in decimal form (i.e. 0.1 for 10%)
#7. At the end of each month, your savings will be increased by the return on your investment, plus a percentage of your 
#monthly salary (annual salary / 12)
#Write a program to calculate how many months it will take you to save up enough money for a down payment
#You will want your main variables to be floats, so you should cast user inputs to floats

#Your program should ask the user to enter the following variables:
#1. The starting annual salary (annual_salary)
#2. The portion of salary to be saved (portion_saved)
#3. The cost of your dream home (total_cost)
